Arabic Symbol Dictionary Word comparer
==========

This program takes a set of word lists with the corresponding frequencies (stored in /lists/ directory  with csv extention), and also takes as input another list. The latter list (input.csv) is the target list for which the program generates three outputs: 1- the words in the latter list but not in the set of lists 2- the words that are in both with scores 3- the words that are only in the set of lists with scores.

The scores are just the frequency of each word in each list in the set of lists.

Usage Details

Just make sure the files in /lists/ directory and the input.csv file are in the write format (csv comma seperated) and run compare.py
